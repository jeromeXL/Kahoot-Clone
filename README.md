# BigBrain


### Background & Motivation

In March 2022 you and your friends pitched a startup idea to produce *An innovative lightweight quiz platform for millenials* that will *revolutionise the secondary and tertiary education market for years*. You pitched this solution in the form of a web-based application, and called this quiz application **BigBrain**.

A week later you received a tentative $50,000 investment from an [Angel Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor) pending you producing a working MVP of the application.

Shortly after you discussed the functionality and feature set with your friends, and wrote out a RESTful specification / interface together so that you can split up the front-end and back-end work between the group.

You (and optionally another one of your friends) decided to work on building the front-end. You wrote a list of requirements and functionalities your frontend should adhere to. You also decided to complete this application in `ReactJS`, a declarative framework for building single page applications. This front-end will interact with a Restful API that your team members are producing, based on the pre-defined interface.

Because your MVP is only going to be demonstrated once, your team considers it imperative that your front-end is thoroughly tested.

To satisfy modern tastes and expectations you have also decided to ensure that the UI/UX and Accessibility standards are very high.

This is closely modelled off the popular game [kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). If you're not familiar with the game, we would recommend spending the time to try it out so that you can get a feel for how this application may function.
