- Navigation buttons are kept in the nav-header to ensure they are easy to find. The nav-header stays at the top of the page regardless of what page the user is on. The nav-header also states which page it is on (E.g. Dashboard, Edit Game) to make it clear to the user what page they're currently on. 

- Links are kept underlined and are obvious, in a contrasting colour. We also desribe concisely where the link takes you, and who should click the link.

- Action buttons are in their typical colour (green for start, red for delete)

- We used Figma to try to use a grid within our layout. This is particularly evident in the Quiz display inside the dashboard. The buttons line up and the start button lines up with the thumbnail. 

- When there are no quizzes/questions, we used text to show that the user had no questions/quizzes, to ensure that the user knew. If we left it blank, the user might not know if they had none, or there was an error in the backend.

- We used Toasts (in green) or alerts when there was a successful user action, to show the user that the action was successful.

- We used modals to focus the users attention on the form they want to fill out. This makes it less distracting and easier for them to complete the task.

- To make it easier for the user to decide on what quiz to choose, we included how recently the quiz was created, along with the total points and the total amount of time. We also made the Quiz name significantly bolder and larger than the other text, as this information is most important, as it provides details about what the quiz is about.

- To make it easier for the users to tell the difference between an Admin and Player login/signup, we used a different yet complimentary colour scheme. Admin has a blue-ish colour palette, whereas Players have a green-ish colour palette.
